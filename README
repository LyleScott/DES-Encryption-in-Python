I was curious how to implement this one weekend so I decided to try it.

This program was written by reading 'DES Algorithm Illustrated' over and over
and over. It was written by J. Orlin Grabbe and it located at http://orlingrabbe.com/des.htm


I did not intend to add error checking or optimizing anything... that was
beside the point. Don't judge me. :P
